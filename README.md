# hello-world
This will be a place to store things that don't have a better place to go.

As I'm new to this process, there probably won't be much here, especially since I prefer heavy organization over randomly heaping things together.  
Ideally, this can at least hold things like possible project ideas and such that don't need an entire repository to themselves.
